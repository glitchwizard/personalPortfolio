## ToDo list:

* Get Anchors to work with the header bar, maybe even make the header bar a sticky one.
* Get Engineering projects to be fed from LinkedIn API projects section of my profile (I thought that would be cool )
* Add Contact Section with all my contact info, or maybe make a contact form and have it email me.
* Fix responsive issues
 - Albums not resizing correctly when page is adjusted
 - Header box containing my name and skills doesn't resize nicely, need to fix that too
